        <h1>Air Fryer Vegan Buffalo Tofu Bites</h1>

        <img src="wings.jpg"/>
        <p>Tofu is breaded and air-fried then tossed in buffalo sauce for vegan buffalo wings to cure your spicy fix without oil. Freezing the tofu gives it a chewy texture that makes this snack just that much better. Serve with fresh veggies and vegan ranch dressing.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) container extra-firm tofu</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons unsweetened rice milk</li>
            <li>¾ cup panko bread crumbs</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>⅔ cup vegan Buffalo wing sauce (such as Frank's®)</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove tofu block from the package and discard liquid. Wrap tofu in cheesecloth, place on a plate, and cover with a heavy pot until remaining liquid has been squeezed out, about 10 minutes. Remove the cheesecloth and cut tofu into 20 1-inch, bite-sized pieces. Place in a freezer-safe container and freeze, 8 hours to overnight.</li>
            <li>Remove tofu from freezer and thaw on paper towels or a dry cheesecloth. Pat dry.</li>
            <li>While tofu is thawing, put cornstarch into a resealable plastic bag. Pour rice milk into a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Preheat an air fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place tofu into the bag with the cornstarch, seal, and shake to coat the tofu pieces completely. Remove tofu pieces and dredge each piece in rice milk.</li>
            <li>Add coated tofu to the air fryer basket and cook for 10 minutes. Shake the basket to loosen the pieces. Cook for another 3 minutes or until browned.</li>
            <li>Place 1/3 cup buffalo sauce in a bowl, add cooked tofu bites, and toss to coat. Drizzle remaining buffalo sauce over tofu and continue tossing to coat. Serve immediately.</li>
